  - "In 1928, Georg Neumann GmbH introduced its very first product: the CMV 3. Known
    colloquially as the \u201CNeumann Bottle\u201D due to its bulky form factor, this
    landmark design employed a completely different method of capturing sound than
    existing designs which utilized carbon granules, metal ribbons, or magnetic coils.
    Instead, it used a thin moving diaphragm and a fixed backplate to turn sound waves
    into an electrical signal based on the change in capacitance between the two elements.\nThe
    very first condensor Mic!"

  - The first microphone that enabled proper voice telephony was the (loose-contact)
    carbon microphone. This was independently developed by David Edward Hughes in
    England and Emile Berliner and Thomas Edison in the US. Although Edison was awarded
    the first patent (after a long legal dispute) in mid-1877, Hughes had demonstrated
    his working device in front of many witnesses some years earlier, and most historians
    credit him with its invention. More on <a style="color:rgb(43, 0, 136)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone"

  - The Neumann U 47 is a large-diaphragm condenser microphone. It is one of the most
    famous studio microphones and was Neumann's first microphone after the Second
    World War. The original series, manufactured by Georg Neumann GmbH between 1949
    and 1965, employed a tube design; early U 47s used the M 7 capsule, then replaced
    by the K 47 from 1958. Units produced before 1950 were distributed by Telefunken
    and bear the Telefunken logo.[1] credit him with its invention. More on <a style="color:rgb(43,
